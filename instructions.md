Yes! Here's the startup sequence:

Start PostgreSQL (if not already running):
# Check status
sudo service postgresql status

# Start if needed
sudo service postgresql start


Verify database connection:
# Quick test connection
psql -U robert -h localhost deliza


Then run your application:
bun start
You can create a simple startup script if you want to automate this:

#!/bin/bash
# startup.sh

# Start PostgreSQL if not running
if ! pg_isready; then
    sudo service postgresql start
    sleep 2  # Give it a moment to start
fi

# Start the application
bun start

But for now, just making sure PostgreSQL is running before starting your app is the key step!
